## About

I'm an Oakland-based software engineer who spends his free time writing, cooking, and playing a truly obscene amount of tabletop RPGs. Since 2012 I've been securing systems, scaling APIs, and solving problems in whatever way I can.

I joined [Noteable](https://noteable.io) in 2020 as their first hire, helping to build a joyful way to collaborate around data. Drop me a line if you want to hear more!

P.S. (It's pronounced _Wuh-old_)
